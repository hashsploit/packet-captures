Mainly captured on sles53729, however have 2 discs and unsure what other code is.
- Ones captured from original gamespy server are from unknown disc, sorry.
- Rooms hosted on fan servers by redirecting a bf2 pc dedicated server to the ps2 game instead, contact for more info if needed. Currently won't allow you to join but with work maybe it will? Access to all the levels from ps2 game is possible to put on server just need to work on joining the server.
